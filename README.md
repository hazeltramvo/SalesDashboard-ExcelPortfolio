# SalesDashboard-ExcelPortfolioExcel Portfolio 
This portfolio is a part of final assessment which indicates what I have learned and achieved from the Module "Advanced Spreadsheet" of my Master course in Business Analysis and Information Systems

### **The Task**
A small computer manufacturing company has commissioned you to create a worksheet that can be used to support financial decision making. You will design, create and test the worksheet.
The worksheet will take the form of a cash flow forecast and will be used to support what if? questioning, such as the impact of a sudden increase in the cost of the compomnents.

### **Design Issues**
In planning your application, it is essential that you make your worksheet as flexible as possible.
Your target user is an experienced manager who has very little knowledge of spreadsheets. This means your application must be intuitive and very easy to use. 
Your are taking the role of a developer, so you are expected to produce work of a professional standard. This means your application must be intuitive and very easy to use.

### Required Features/ Functionality
Your completed application must include:

- At least one fully working UserForm
- Use of cell protection, data validation and conditional formatting
- Clear documentation of VBA code; code must also be formatted correctly
- Clear and uncluttered layout; user interface design should cater for the target user
- Use of appropriate instructions and errors messages
- Ability to import or update relevant data from a database or web page.
- Good use of Excel's advanced features e.g. charts, formulas, macros, etc.
- Good use of at least one advanced technique (e.g. Monte Carlo Simulation)
- A dashboard of your own design - you will need to justify your design and your choice of information to be displayed to users.
